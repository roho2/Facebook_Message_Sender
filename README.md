# Facebook_Message_Sender
Python program to access Facebook and send a message to someone through the program

When the program is run, it prompts you for your Facebook username, password, 
who you want to send a message to, and what you want the message to say.
It logs into your account and sends the message if the person exists on your friend list. 

After sending it waits 120 seconds to avoid Facebook saying it is suspicious activity (logging in and then logging out directly after).
Then it logs you out.
